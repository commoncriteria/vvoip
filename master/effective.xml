    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a Voice/Video over IP (VVoIP)
      endpoint in terms of <xref g="CC"/> and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
      f
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software, Version 1.4 (App PP)</h:li>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices, Version 3.0e (NDcPP)</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      
      <h:p>
        These Base-PPs are both valid because a VVoIP endpoint is a specific type of network device or software
        application that carries sensitive data over remote channels and uses protocols to do so that a typical
        network device or software application does not implement. Therefore, additional security requirements
        are necessary to ensure that sensitive communications are not subject to unauthorized disclosure to
        unintended recipients.
      </h:p><h:p>
        Note that the NDcPP defines an optional architecture for a “distributed TOE” that allows for security
        functionality to be spread across multiple distinct components. However, a TOE that conforms to the
        NDcPP and this PP-Module will not be a distributed TOE. All security functionality will be contained within
        a single physical device.

    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
		<h:p>
			This PP-Module specifically addresses a dedicated network device or software application that facilitates
      the exchange of voice or video communication across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The endpoint is
      a client (TOE) that communicates with a VVoIP call control server and may serve as its own call control
      server when using P2P. The VVoIP endpoint shall be able to secure file download from a file server to
      update VVoIP endpoint software and configuration, to establish secure communication for call control
      with the call control server, and to secure streaming media to other devices.
   	</h:p><h:p>
			The combination of the NDcPP and this PP-Module is a network device that provides VVoIP endpoint
      functionality in addition to all of the security functionality expected of a network device as mandated by
      the NDcPP. The combination of the App PP and this PP-Module is a software application running on a
      general-purpose operating system that includes VVoIP endpoint capabilities in addition to all of the
      security functionality expected of a software application as mandated by the App PP.
    </h:p><h:p>
      This PP-Module describes the functional requirements and threats specific to the VVoIP endpoint. The
      most notable additions are requirements for the call control protocol (SIP, H.323) and streaming media
      protocol (SRTP, RTP). A conformant TOE is expected to be a standalone device or application; distributed
      TOE’s are not permitted.
</h:p>
	</sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
	<!-- 1.4 TOE_Boundary -->
    <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        <h:p>The TOE boundary includes the VVoIP-capable device or application (VVoIP endpoint). A VVoIP-capable
			device is a dedicated phone whereas a VVoIP endpoint application is just one of many applications that
			runs on a general-purpose device such as a smartphone, tablet, or PC. Regardless of whether the TOE is a
			hardware appliance or a client application on an operating system, it will be deployed in the same
			environment. The figure below shows a typical VVoIP infrastructure from the perspective of the TOE.
			Many of the environmental components have direct connections between one another, but since these
			are not visible to the TOE, these connections have not been depicted.</h:p>
			<figure entity="images/Toe.png" title="Typical VVoIP Deployment" id="toeDeployment"/>
		<h:p>The TOE uses a VVoIP call control server, either by connecting to an ESC or acting as one itself when using
			P2P, in order to set up connections with other VVoIP endpoint devices or other telephony equipment such
			as a conference bridge. The call control server also may have the ability to deliver software/firmware
			updates to the TOE, but this can alternatively be performed by a file server. The TOE must be able to
			process Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and/or IPv6 packets.</h:p>
		<h:p>To be able to initiate communications in a client-server architecture, the TOE needs at minimum an IP
			address, network mask, gateway address, configuration server address, update server address (or may
			rely on platform for updates if it is a software application configured to do so), and call control server
			address. The address may be obtained by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), manually entered
			on the VVoIP endpoint, or inherited from the device the TOE resides on (if it is a software application);
			addresses can belong to the same device if it performs multiple functions (such as an ESC which also
			performs updates). The TOE should allow basic telephony functions. Once the IP addresses are obtained,
			the TOE downloads any VVoIP application updates, downloads VVoIP endpoint configuration, and
			connects to the call control server as a VVoIP client. When a call is finished or the line is otherwise not in
			use, the TOE will ensure that streaming media communication paths/ports are closed while call control
			remains open.</h:p>
		<h:p>To be able to initiate communications in P2P, the TOE needs at minimum an IP address, network mask,
			gateway address, and update server address (or may rely on platform for updates if it is a software
			application configured to do so). The address may be obtained by DHCP, manually entered on the VVoIP
			endpoint, or inherited from the device the TOE resides on (if it is a software application). The TOE should
			allow basic telephony functions. Once the IP addresses are obtained, the TOE downloads any VVoIP application updates. The endpoint configuration for P2P TOE of telephony functions is local. When the
			TOE initiates a call, the TOE connects to the other peer’s call control (which is active) and the TOE is a
			client. When the TOE receives a call, the other peer acts as a client and connects to the TOE’s call control.
			When a call is finished or the line is otherwise not in use, the TOE will ensure that streaming media
			communication paths/ports are closed while call control remains open.</h:p>
		<h:p>The TOE has three paths for three different functions that need to execute: streaming media path that
			contains voice, video, and session control (endpoint to endpoint); call control path to control the endpoint
			(endpoint to VVoIP call control server), and configuration/management path to configure and manage the
			TOE (software/firmware updates, configuration updates, audit).</h:p>
			
    </sec:TOE_Boundary>


    <!-- 1.5 Use Cases -->
    <sec:Use_Cases>
    	<h:p>
			This PP-Module defines four potential use cases for the VVoIP TOE, defined below. The first two use cases
			define the physical embodiment of the TOE, while the latter two define its role in a telecommunications
			deployment.</h:p>
		<h:p>
			Regardless of the physical embodiment of the TOE, the expected functional capabilities are similar.
			However, when the TOE is deployed in a peer-to-peer architecture, it must perform auditing and call
			control functions that a client-server TOE does not need to perform because the Enterprise Session
			Controller provides those functions in that architecture. A client-server TOE may also perform its own
			auditing, but it is not required.</h:p>
      <usecases>
        <usecase id="usecase1" title="Dedicated Appliance">
          <description>
            The VVoIP endpoint is sold and packaged as a standalone network appliance that does not have
			a direct interface to the underlying platform operating system. In this use case, conformance to
			the NDcPP and this PP-Module is sufficient to ensure security. Note that the NDcPP defines
			optional functionality for “distributed TOEs” – for a TOE to conform to this PP-Module, it must be
			a single device and not a distributed TOE.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        
        <usecase id="usecase2" title="Software Application">
          <description>
            The VVoIP endpoint is sold and packaged as an application that is installed on a general-purpose
			computer or mobile device running a modifiable operating system (such as Windows or Linux).
			This computer may run end user applications above and beyond those used for VVoIP
			communications since it functions as a user workstation. In this case, the VVoIP endpoint
			application is expected to conform to both this PP-Module and the App PP.

   <section title="Implementation-Based Features" id="sec-features">
      The following features of the TOE are implementation-based. A TOE is not required to implement these features to conform to this PP-Module, but if the feature is implemented, it is expected that associated implementation-based requirements are claimed as part of the TSF.

          <description>The TOE is a software application and claims the App-PP as the Base-PP. The TOE additionally implements logging features (i.e. includes one or more of the following SFRs in the ST: 
		  FAU_GEN.1/CSADMIN, FAU_GEN.1/CSVVOIP, FAU_GEN.1/P2PADMIN, FAU_GEN.1/P2PVVOIP).</description>

  	<!-- <section title="Test Environment for Evaluation Activities">
  		<h:p>
  		This section contains the expectations for the evaluator test environment that is used to perform the
  		test specified by the EAs.
  		</h:p><h:p>
  		It is assumed the evaluator will have tools suitable to establish sessions, modify or create session packets,
  		and perceive whether packets are getting through the TOE as well as to examine the content of those
  		packets. In general, it is expected that IPS rule configuration and logging capabilities of the TOE can be
  		used to reach appropriate determinations where applicable.
  		</h:p><h:p>
  		The tests need to be repeated for each distinct network interface type capable of monitoring network
  		traffic on all ‘sensor’ interfaces of the TOE, which may include ‘promiscuous’ interfaces (with or without
  		an IP address or IP stack, and whether or not the interfaces are capable of attempting to terminate
  		unapproved traffic flows by transmitting packets such as TCP resets), and inline (pass-through) interfaces
  		with or without an IP address or IP stack, but not management interfaces used to remotely access the
  		TOE, or used by the TOE to initiate outbound connections to syslog servers, AAA servers, remote traffic
  		filtering devices, etc.
  		</h:p><h:p>
  		The evaluators shall minimally create a test environment that is functionally equivalent to the test
  		environment illustrated below. The evaluators must provide justification for any differences in the test
  		environment. The TOE may be a distributed TOE in which some SFRs or elements of SFRs are enforced
  		by separate TOE components distributed across a network. For distributed TOEs: <h:ul>
  		<h:li>the “TOE” in the “inline mode test topology” must be the TOE component that controls the
  		flow of traffic, but that TOE component does not need to be the same component that collects
  		or analyzes the traffic;</h:li>
  		<h:li>the “TOE” in the “promiscuous mode test topology” must be the TOE component that
  		communicates with the non-TOE traffic filtering device, but that TOE component does not need
  		to be the same component that collects or analyzes the traffic.</h:li>
  		</h:ul>
  		</h:p><h:p>
  		IPS devices that can be deployed in more than one mode, two instantiations of the TOE will more than
  		likely make it easier to conduct testing, however, the evaluator is free to construct a test-bed where one
  		instance of a TOE exists and there is a device that provides the necessary functions to interact with the
  		TOE to satisfy the testing activities.
  		</h:p><h:p>
  			<figure entity="images/inline_mode.png" title="Sample Inline Mode Test Topology" id="inlinemode"/>
  	   <h:br/><h:br/>
  			<figure entity="images/promiscuous_mode.png" title="Sample Promiscuous Mode Test Topology" id="promiscuousmode"/>
  			
  		It is expected that the traffic generator is used to construct network packets and will provide the evaluator
  		with the ability to simulate network attacks. The traffic generator can be a COTS (commercial off the shelf),
  		shareware, or freeware product; special equipment is not necessary.

        When this PP-Module is used to extend the NDcPP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a network

		the network device.

      </con-toe>

      <con-obj/>
      <con-op-en>The objectives for the TOE’s operational environment are consistent with the NDcPP based on the following rationale: </con-op-en>
      
      
		<con-mod ref="T.UNDETECTED_TRANSMISSION">
			The NDcPP defines threats for insecure communications and undetected
			activity. Unauthorized and undetected use of a communications channel is
			consistent with these threats.
		</con-mod>
		<con-mod ref="T.MEDIA_DISCLOSURE">
			The NDcPP defines a threat for untrusted communications channels. The
			threat of media disclosure through vocoder frames is a type of sidechannel attack that is unique to the functions of a VVoIP endpoint.
			However, it is consistent with the overall threat of unintended disclosure
			of sensitive data.
		</con-mod>
		<con-mod ref="A.UPDATE_SOURCE">
			The NDcPP does not have any assumptions for the source of TOE updates,
			only that the updates have adequate integrity protections. There is no
			conflict with this Module assuming that TOE updates will be retrieved
			from a particular location.
		</con-mod>
		  
		<con-mod ref="OE.UPDATE_SOURCE">
			The NDcPP requires the TOE to be able to apply software/firmware updates
			but does not define any specific way that these updates need to be made
			available. This PP-Module defines an objective that allows for an assumption
			that TOE updates will be made available in a specific location.
			A.UPDATE_SOURCE is consistent with the Base-PP objectives for the same
			reason.

			management functions that relate specifically to VVoIP functionality. The
			addition of these functions does not prevent any of the original functions

			management functions specified in the Base-PP; this is consistent because it
			is possible that auditing is handled differently for the VVoIP functionality as
			it is for the rest of the TOE’s auditing. These functions are also selectable so
			it is not required that a conformant TOE implement this.</con-mod>

						communications to secure transmitted data, mandating support for TLS, and
						permitting support for SRTP. The first two modifications are derived from
						selections that are already present in the App PP version of the SFR. The
						addition of SRTP does not prevent any of the other protocols from being
						used if supported.

			When this PP-Module is used to extend the App PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a software
			application. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the VVoIP endpoint functionality that is
			supported by the application.
		</con-toe>
		<con-sec-prob>
			The threats and assumptions defined by this PP-Module (see sections 3.1 and 3.2) supplement those
			defined in the App PP as follows:
		</con-sec-prob>
		<con-obj/>
		<con-op-en>The objectives for the TOE’s operational environment are consistent with the App-PP based on the following rationale:</con-op-en>
		<con-mod ref="T.UNDETECTED_TRANSMISSION">
			The App PP defines threats for network attack and network eavesdropping.
			Unauthorized and undetected use of a communications channel is
			consistent with these threats.
		</con-mod>
		<con-mod ref="T.MEDIA_DISCLOSURE">
			The App PP defines a threat for network eavesdropping. The threat of media
			disclosure through vocoder frames is a type of side-channel attack that is
			unique to the functions of a VVoIP endpoint. However, it is consistent with
			the overall threat of unintended disclosure of sensitive data.
		</con-mod>
		<con-mod ref="A.UPDATE_SOURCE">
			The App PP does not have any assumptions for the source of TOE updates,
			only that the updates have adequate integrity protections. There is no
			conflict with this Module assuming that TOE updates will be retrieved from a
			particular location.
		</con-mod>
		<con-mod ref="OE.UPDATE_SOURCE">
		<comment>This rationale could be interpreted as vague or conflicting with FPT_TUD_EXT.2, as applications 
		that are not packaged with the OS do have format requirements. There is no defined requirement for update location, since 
		there may be an alternate use case where "the place you get the app from" is different from "the mobile device vendor's app store" 
		because an MDM might have a separate mobile app server that devices enrolled in the MDM must use. Is this still an anticipated 
		use case? If so, the objective may need to be reworded in terms of a generic "trusted source" to make clear that 
		this module is not conflicting with FPT_TUD_EXT.2's requirements.</comment>
			The App PP requires the TOE to be able to apply software/firmware updates
			but does not define any specific way that these updates need to be made
			available. This PP-Module defines an objective that allows for an assumption
			that TOE updates will be made available in a specific location.
			A.UPDATE_SOURCE is consistent with the Base-PP objectives for the same
			reason.

			<h:p>The evaluator shall also examine the guidance documentation to determine that it describes the
				relationship between the local audit data and the audit data that are sent to the audit log server. For
				example, when an audit event is generated, is it simultaneously sent to the external server and the local
				store, or is the local store used as a buffer and “cleared” periodically by sending the data to the audit
				server.</h:p>
			</Guidance>
			<Tests>
			<h:p>Testing of the trusted channel mechanism for audit will be performed as specified in the associated EAs
				for the particular trusted channel mechanism. The evaluator shall perform the following additional tests
				for this requirement:</h:p>
			<testlist>
				<test><h:p>The evaluator shall establish a session between the TOE and the audit server according to the
						configuration guidance provided. The evaluator shall then examine the traffic that passes between the
						audit server and the TOE during several activities of the evaluator’s choice designed to generate audit
						data to be transferred to the audit server. The evaluator shall observe that these data are not able to be
						viewed in the clear during this transfer, and that they are successfully received by the audit server. The
						evaluator shall record the particular software (name, version) used on the audit server during testing. The
						evaluator shall verify that the TOE is capable of transferring audit data to an external audit server
						automatically without administrator intervention.</h:p>
					<h:p>If the ability to modify this behavior is configurable (e.g. if the TOE can be configured to transmit audit
						data either to an ESC to which it is registered or to an external trusted IT entity that is not an ESC), the
						evaluator shall repeat this test as necessary to show that changing the available configuration options will
						result in the TOE performing the expected behavior in each case.</h:p>

	<appendix id="implicit-reqs" title="Implicitly Satisfied Requirements">
		<h:p>This appendix lists requirements that should be considered satisfied by products successfully evaluated
			against this PP-Module. However, these requirements are not featured explicitly as SFRs and should not
			be included in the ST. They are not included as standalone SFRs because it would increase the time, cost,
			and complexity of evaluation. This approach is permitted by [CC] Part 1, 8.2 Dependencies between
			components.</h:p>
		<h:p>This information benefits systems engineering activities which call for inclusion of particular security
			controls. Evaluation against the PP-Module provides evidence that these controls are present and have
			been evaluated.</h:p>

		<h:table>
			<h:tr class="header">
				<h:td>Requirement</h:td>
				<h:td>Rationale for Satisfaction</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FAU_GEN.2 – User identity association</h:td>
				<h:td>
					The iterations of FAU_GEN.1.2 explicitly requires that the OS
					record any user account associated with each event; therefore,
					it is duplicative to include a separate requirement to associate a
					user account with each event.
					If the TOE claims conformance to the NDcPP, the dependency is
					explicitly met through FAU_GEN.2.
				</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FIA_UID.1 – Timing of Identification</h:td>
				<h:td>
					<h:p>For the purpose of logging and processing VVoIP telephony
					functions, the TOE is identified solely by underlying system or
					configuration characteristics (e.g. IP address, phone number)
					independent of the identity of the user interacting with the
					TOE.</h:p>
					<h:p>When the TOE is a software application, neither this PP-Module
					nor the Base-PP (App PP) define a separate identification and
					authentication mechanism for the software application to
					interact with its management interface. The software
					application assumes that accessing the OS platform itself is
					sufficient to grant access to the application. For accountability
					purposes, the user of the TOE is identified as the user that
					logged in to the OS platform and subsequently interacted with
					the TSF.</h:p>
				</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FMT_MSA.1 – Management of Security Attributes</h:td>
				<h:td>
					<h:p>This SFR defines the TOE security attributes that can be
					managed and what management role can administer them.
					Specifically, this is indirectly dependent on FDP_IFF.1. The PP-Module defines two iterations of FDP_IFF.1. Each of these
					iterations define explicit rules that determine when the TSF
					transmits call control and media data.</h:p>
					<h:p>The relevant attributes are either directly under the control of
					an ordinary user, such that no specific security authorization is
					needed, or they are entirely under the control of the TSF and
					cannot be influenced by the user regardless of privilege. An
					example of the first case in that in FDP_IFF.1.2, whether or not
					the TOE is in the off-hook state or the mute state is
					controllable by a user with physical access to the TOE and does 
					not require the assumption of an administrative role. An
					example of the second case is in FDP_IFF.1.2/CallControl,
					where the TSF will determine if the other end of the
					connection is a valid VVoIP endpoint, which is something the
					user has no ability to configure or influence.</h:p>
				</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FMT_MSA.3 – Static Attribute Initialization</h:td>
				<h:td>
					<h:p>This SFR is a dependency on FDP_IFF.1. The PP-Module defines
					two iterations of FDP_IFF.1. Each of these iterations define
					explicit rules that determine when the TSF transmits call
					control and media data. FMT_MSA.3 has not been specified
					because the default state of the attributes used to determine if
					data flow is authorized is not relevant to enforcement of the
					rules.</h:p>
					<h:p>
					For example, FDP_IFF.1.2 states that the TSF will not transmit
					media data within a call if the TOE is in the mute state.
					Whether the call starts with the mute state active or inactive
					does not affect the enforcement of the rule, and requiring the
					ST to state this information does not affect the security of the
					TSF.</h:p>
				</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FMT_SMR.1 – Security Roles</h:td>
				<h:td>
					<h:p>When the TOE is a software application, neither this PP-Module
					nor the Base-PP (App PP) define security roles that are
					authorized to perform management functionality on the TSF.
					For user access, the TOE does not require separate
					authentication to the TSF because authentication to the OS
					platform on which the TOE is installed is sufficient user access
					control; a user logged in to the OS platform is assumed to be a
					valid user of the TOE.</h:p>
					<h:p>If the TOE is registered to an ESC, the ESC may be able to issue
					management commands to the TOE. No separate ‘user role’ is
					needed to define this because the ESC is not a ‘user’ and so
					FMT_SMR.1.2 is not applicable in this context. The ESC’s
					authorization to manage the TSF is implicitly granted through
					the user registering the TOE to the ESC.</h:p>
				</h:td>
			</h:tr>
			<h:tr>
				<h:td>FPT_STM.1 – Reliable time stamps</h:td>
				<h:td>
					<h:p>The iterations of FAU_GEN.1.2 explicitly requires that the
					software application TSF associate timestamps with audit
					records; therefore it is duplicative to include a separate
					timestamp requirement. Additionally, the App PP has an
					assumption of relying upon a trustworthy computing platform
					with a reliable time clock for its execution, so the dependency is
					also met through the assumption.</h:p>
					<h:p>Alternatively, if the TOE is registered to an ESC, the selection-based requirement FPT_STM_EXT.1/VVoIP must be claimed,
					which is sufficient to address the dependency as the TSF will
					receive time data from the operational environment that is
					assumed to be reliable.</h:p>
					<h:p>If the TOE claims conformance to the NDcPP, the dependency is
					also explicitly met through FPT_STM_EXT.1, regardless of whether the TOE is deployed in a client-server configuration
					(with registration to an ESC) or peer-to-peer configuration (with
					no ESC involved).</h:p>
